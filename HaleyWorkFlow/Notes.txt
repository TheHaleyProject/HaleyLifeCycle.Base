WORKFLOW ENGINE:

	1. Load and cache workflow definitions
	2. Instantiate workflows with parameters and overrides
	3. Execute steps in order, respecting dependencies and phases
	4. Track status transitions and retries
	5. Handle timeouts, failures, and external triggers
	6. Persist state to MariaDB and support crash recovery
